# UFOs
## Overview
This project was designed to create a new webpage that allows us to interactively filter a data table.
Our data table provides easily accessible data on UFO sightings. The filtering allows users to dive into the data in depth if they wish.
## Results
![](static/images/unfiltered.png)
* If the filter fields on the left hand side of the webpage are left untouched, the page will show all results in our dataset shown above

* The webpage will automatically update if any field recieves user input in any of the fields
* In this photo we are searching for UFO sightings recorded on 1/2/2010
* You can input more than one filter if you would like

## Drawbacks
* The webpage is not very sleek in design
* Search fields are not forgiving about filtering inputs
* Date input is currently done as "text" when it could be a dropdown calendar
